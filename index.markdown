Hi. <br>

I'm Liz.

Originally from Philadelphia, PA, I hold a B.A. from [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/) and an M.A. in English from the [University of Virginia](https://english.as.virginia.edu/). <br>

I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Literary & Studies at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/).
