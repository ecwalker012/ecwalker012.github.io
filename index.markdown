Hi. I'm Liz.<br>

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the English department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/).<br>

I hold an M.A. in English from the [University of Virginia](https://english.as.virginia.edu/) and a B.A. from [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/).<br>

During the two years between UVa and CMU, I was wheelin' and dealin' in the world of antique, vintage, and collectible smalls.<br>

If you have questions about literature broadly, contemporary Caribbean-American literature specifically, or Italian art glass paperweights, please email me.
