Hi. I'm Liz. <br>

I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the English department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/).

Originally from Philadelphia, PA, I hold a B.A. from [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/) and an M.A. in English from the [University of Virginia](https://english.as.virginia.edu/). <br>

During the two years between UVa and CMU, I was wheelin' and dealin' in the world of antique, vintage, and collectible "smalls."<br>

If you have any questions about literature broadly, contemporary Caribbean-American literature specifically, or (knockoff) Italian art glass paperweights, please shoot me an email.
