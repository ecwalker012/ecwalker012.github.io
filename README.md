# ecwalker012.github.io

This is my personal website.

There are notes to remember how to get everything up and running:

1. open powershell, `cd .\Documents\GitHub\ecwalker012.github.io\`
2. open up atom and project with `atom .`
3. start up test server `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
4. use github desktop to commit changes
